<!-- *High-level scenarios to adopt, use and share the product.* -->
## Adoption Scenarios

In order to grow our user base, our goal is to get the app in front of as many people as possible. Our product is intuitive and user-friendly, which we believe will lead to long-term user retention.  To achieve this, we will focus on the following strategies:

1. Social Media Sharing
    - Users can share their meals on social media platforms to showcase their healthy lifestyle.
2. Influencer Partnerships
    - We will partner with influencers in the health and fitness space to promote our app.
3. Community Sharing
    - As users begin to post within the app, more members of the community will be drawn in to see what others are eating.

## User Stories and Key Features

### User Stories

1. **Daily Calorie Tracking:** As a health enthusiast, I want to take a picture of my meal to receive an accurate calorie count and nutritional breakdown.
2. **Healthy Meal Inspiration:** As a person on a diet, I want to search for recipes based on my dietary preferences to discover new, healthy meal options.
3. **Barcode Scanning:** As a busy professional, I want to scan the barcode of a product to quickly access its nutritional information without manual entry.
4. **Data Charts:** As a data-driven individual, I want to view charts of my daily calorie intake over time to track my progress and make informed dietary decisions.
5. **Social Sharing:** As a social influencer, I want to share my meals with others to showcase my healthy lifestyle and gain inspiration from their posts.



### Key Features

The following are the key features required for the MVP and their importance:

1. More flexible nutrient tracking (more than calories and macros)
    - People who track their micronutrients will require a feature that accepts more detailed nutritional information when creating ingredients.
2. Health app integration
    - People who are monitoring their weight will require a feature that integrates with health apps to monitor their weight and display progress. 
    - Otherwise, users will have to input their weight manually, which is time-consuming and inconvenient.
3. Improved image recognition
    - People who are depending on the image recognition feature will require highly accurate nutritional analysis.
    - If not, they will have to manually input the nutritional information, which defeats our differentiation from other apps.
4. Saved Ingredients
    - People who frequently use the same ingredients will require a feature that allows them to save ingredients for future use. 
    - If not, they will have to manually input the same ingredients every time they create a meal which is a poor user experience.


## Success Criteria

Our MVP will be considered successful if we achieve the following:

- Grow to 10,000 active users within the first 6 months
    - We will measure user penetration through the number of downloads and active users
- 80% of users are satisfied with the app
    - We will measure satisfaction through in-app satisfaction surveys and play store reviews.
- 10% of users are willing to pay for premium features
    - If we can get 10% of users to pay for premium features, the app will achieve financial sustainability


### Partnerships

In order to further grow our user base, partnerships would provide a great opportunity. We would consider partnerships with the following:

1. Gyms
    - Offering the premium features of the app at a discounted or free rate to gym members.
2. Health Food Companies
    - Add a QR code to the packaging of products that can be scanned to recieve a free trials of premium features.

## Features Outside the Scope

We have many features that we would like to include in the app, but are not necessary for the MVP. These features include:

- Allergen tracking
    - Upon scanning a meal, the app will identify any allergens present in the meal.
- Recipe recommendations based on dietary preferences
    - The app will recommend recipes based on the user's dietary preferences.
- Fitness Programs
    - The app will provide fitness programs to help users achieve their health goals.
- Nutrient Coaching
    - Through Generative AI, the app will provide nutrient coaching to teach users which nutrients they are lacking in their diet, and why they are important.

Once we have achieved success with the MVP, we will consider integrating these features into the app. Priority will be given to features directly related to food and nutrition, and then we will consider features that are more fitness-oriented. As such, we would prioritize allergen tracking and recipe recommendations before fitness programs and nutrient coaching.
