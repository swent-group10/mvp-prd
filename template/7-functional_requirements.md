# Functional Requirements

## Key Features of the MVP

### 1. Registration

**Motivation**
To provide a seamless and secure user experience, the app must support user registration and login via a reliable and widely-used authentication method. Using Google account authentication simplifies the process for users and leverages existing security protocols.

**Proposed Solution**
- Implement Google Sign-In for Android to allow users to authenticate using their Google account.
- Ensure that the authentication process is secure and user data is protected.
- Leverage Firebase Authentication to manage user sessions and simplify integration.

### 2. Core Functionality

#### Scan with Camera

**Motivation**
The ability to scan food items using the camera is essential for determining the composition of the food, which is the primary function of the app. This feature allows users to quickly and easily get nutritional information without manually entering data.

**Proposed Solution**
- Integrate an image recognition API (Spoonacular) to enable the camera to scan and identify food items.
- Use the MealViewModel to handle the initialization and updates of meal data from camera scans.
- Store the results in the local database and synchronize with Firebase.

#### Track Nutritional Intakes

**Motivation**
Logging food intake is crucial for users to track their diet and nutrition over time. Providing an easy way to register meals and snacks ensures users can maintain accurate records.

**Proposed Solution**
- Develop a user-friendly interface for logging food intake, categorized by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack).
- Utilize the MealViewModel to initialize default values or use picture results.
- Store the logged data locally and sync it with Firebase for access across devices.

#### Visualizing Consumption Habits and Tracking Progress

**Motivation**
Users need to visualize their consumption patterns and progress towards their nutritional goals. Graphs and charts provide an intuitive way to track and analyze dietary habits.

**Proposed Solution**
- Implement a dashboard that displays user data through various graphs and charts.
- Use the GraphViewModel to get data from the MealRepository and format it for display.
- Ensure the data is updated in real-time as users log their intake.

#### Scanning Product Barcodes

**Motivation**
Allowing users to scan barcodes of final products provides a quick and efficient way to get detailed nutritional information, saving time and effort.

**Proposed Solution**
- Use a barcode scanning API to read product barcodes and get product ID.
- Use a food database API (OpenFoodFacts) to retrieve product's nutritional information.
- Use the BarcodeViewModel to handle barcode scans and display nutritional information.

#### Recipe Recommendations

**Motivation**
Based on the userâ€™s scanned items and dietary preferences, suggesting recipes helps users make better food choices and utilize available ingredients effectively.

**Proposed Solution**
- Use a recipe API (Spoonacular) to fetch recipes based on a food item.
- Integrate a recipe database for filtering based on user preferences and available ingredients.
- Provide step-by-step instructions and nutritional information for suggested recipes.

#### Nutritional Analysis

**Motivation**
Providing detailed nutritional information for scanned items is essential for users to understand their dietary intake and make informed choices.

**Proposed Solution**
- Retrieve and display macronutrient and micronutrient information from the APIs.
- Allow users to view detailed breakdowns of their daily, weekly, and monthly intake.
- Use a standardized nutritional database to ensure accuracy and consistency.

#### Create and Share Posts

**Motivation**
Creating and sharing posts allows users to interact with the community, share experiences. This feature can enhance user engagement.

**Proposed Solution**
- Develop a social feature that allows users to create posts with text, images, and location tags using the CreatePostViewModel.
- Use Firebase for post storage and retrieval, handled by the PostRepository.

#### View Posts within a Radius

**Motivation**
Viewing posts within a specific radius helps users connect with others nearby, fostering a sense of community and local support.

**Proposed Solution**
- Implement location-based filtering (Geofire) to show posts from users within a specified radius using the MapViewModel.
- Use geolocation services to determine user locations and calculate distances.
- Ensure user privacy by allowing location sharing only with explicit consent.

### 3. User Interface

**Motivation**
A consistent and intuitive user interface ensures a positive user experience and easy navigation throughout the app.

**Proposed Solution**
- Utilize Material Design 3 (M3) elements to create a cohesive and modern UI.
- Conduct user testing to refine the interface and improve usability.

### 4. Data Storage

**Motivation**
Storing user data locally ensures quick access and offline functionality, while syncing with Firebase Firestore provides data backup and multi-device access.

**Proposed Solution**
- Implement local storage using Room for offline access.
- Use Firebase Firestore for cloud synchronization and backup.
- Ensure data consistency and handle conflict resolution during sync.

### 5. Multi-Device Sync

**Motivation**
Allowing users to access their data across multiple devices enhances convenience and ensures a seamless experience.

**Proposed Solution**
- Utilize Firebase Authentication to manage user sessions across devices.
- Implement real-time data sync using Firebase Firestore to keep data consistent.
- Ensure that the user experience is seamless when switching between devices, meaning the user should be able to start a session on one device and continue on another without losing data or functionality.

### Key Internal Functionality

**Overview**

The internal functionality of the app is divided into three main layers: UI, Domain, and Data. The app integrates with various third-party APIs and services to provide comprehensive food tracking and nutritional analysis features. The Firebase platform is used for user authentication and data synchronization.

#### ViewModels

**Motivation**

ViewModels are used to manage the UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.

**Implementation**
- **OverviewViewModel**: Uses data about meals and user preferences to display graphs and information about the current day.
- **GraphViewModel**: Fetches data from the meal repository and formats it for display in graphs.
- **MealViewModel**: Initializes meal data from camera scans or manual entry and handles changes to meal data.
- **DailyRecapViewModel**: Initializes with meals from the current day and fetches new data when the date is changed.
- **BarcodeViewModel**: Handles the scanning of barcodes and retrieves nutritional information.
- **CreatePostViewModel**: Manages data for creating posts, including location data, and uploads posts to Firebase.
- **MapViewModel**: Manages the fetching and displaying of posts within a specified radius.

#### Repositories

**Motivation**

Repositories handle data operations. They provide a clean API for data access to the rest of the application, abstracting the source of data (local database, network, etc.).

**Implementation**
- **MealRepository**: Manages meal data from both local storage and Firebase. It queries local data first and syncs with Firebase if data is missing.
- **PostRepository**: Manages the retrieval and storage of posts, handling data from both Firebase and local storage.

#### Data Management

**Motivation**

Efficient data management ensures quick access, synchronization across devices, and offline capabilities.

**Implementation**
- **LocalDB**: Stores user data, meal data, barcode information, and post data locally using Room.
- **Firebase**: Used for user authentication, cloud storage, and data synchronization. Services include Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Firebase Storage.
- **GeoFire**: A Firebase library used for geolocation queries to manage and query location data for posts.

#### External APIs

**Motivation**

Integrating external APIs allows the app to provide detailed nutritional information, recipe suggestions, and barcode data.

**Implementation**
- **Spoonacular API**: Used for recipe suggestions, image analysis, and nutritional information.
- **OpenFoodFacts API**: Used for retrieving barcode information and food composition data.
